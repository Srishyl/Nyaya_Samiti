    # Example Usage and Setup Notes
    # 1. Dataset: Requires a dataset of signature images with labels (genuine/forged).
    # 2. Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization.
    # 3. Training: Define a loss function (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss), an optimizer.
    # 4. Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

    # Dummy data for demonstration
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1),
        transforms.Resize((150, 220)), # Example size for signature images
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
    ])

    # Create a dummy image tensor
    dummy_image = Image.new('RGB', (150, 220), color = 'white')
    dummy_input = transform(dummy_image).unsqueeze(0) # Add batch dimension

    # Initialize DocSignatureNet
    model = DocSignatureNet(num_classes=2)

    # Forward pass
    output = model(dummy_input)
    print("Output shape:", output.shape) # Expected: torch.Size([1, 2]) for 2 classes
