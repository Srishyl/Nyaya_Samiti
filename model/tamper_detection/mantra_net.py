# Placeholder for ManTra-Net architecture
# ManTra-Net is a complex model, this is a simplified conceptual outline.
# A full implementation would involve: 
# 1. A global stream for feature extraction (e.g., ResNet-like).
# 2. A local stream for processing patches (e.g., a shallow CNN).
# 3. An attention mechanism to combine global and local features.
# 4. A decision network for forgery localization.

    # Example Usage and Setup Notes
    # 1. Dataset: Image forgery datasets with pixel-level ground truth masks (e.g., CASIA, Coverage).
    # 2. Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization for image inputs.
    # 3. Training: Use a loss function suitable for semantic segmentation (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss for each pixel).
    # 4. Evaluation: Pixel accuracy, F1-score for forgery localization.

    # Dummy data for demonstration (e.g., 3-channel RGB image)
